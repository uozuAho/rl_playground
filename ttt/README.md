# quick start
Install uv

```sh
make init
make pc
make rank
# see makefile for more

uv run sb3-dqn-tuna.py # use optuna to find good hyperparams for DQN
uv run optuna-dashboard sqlite:///dqn-ttt.db  # see hyperparam report
uv run tabular-param-search.py  # try a range of parameters for training. Not
                                # as smart as optuna
```


# todo
- WIP experiment: max out gpu in train and eval
    - idea: threaded step gen
    - idea: pre-compute as much as possible before moving to gpu for calc
- perf: maybe: follow answer.md
- see my other todo notes
- add `ty check` to make pc. lots of errors
