# Cartpole agent using reinforce algorithm

From https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit4/hands-on

Reinforce is a policy gradient algorithm, ie. it learns a policy function that
outputs an action policy distribution, rather than a state-action value
estimation.

# Quick start
```sh
uv sync
uv run reinforce.py
```
