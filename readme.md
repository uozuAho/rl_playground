# Reinforcement learning (RL) playground

This is me trying to learn practical RL.
Inspired by this course: https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course

At the moment, mostly using
[stable baselines](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io)
PPO algorithm to train agents in toy environments in
[gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).

I've copied code from various places, attributed in-place. I think everything
I've grabbed is MIT, so assume that license I guess.


# Other stuff I've done
Every now and then I get interested in AI/RL/machine learning. My trail of
destruction:

## kinda relevant to RL
- [blackjack: tabular(?) learning methods](https://github.com/uozuAho/rl_montecarlo_blackjack)
- [open spiel playground](https://github.com/uozuAho/open_spiel_playground)
    - playing around with open spiel

## not very relevant
- [ts_ai2](https://github.com/uozuAho/ts_ai2)
    - a bunch of classical search algorithms in typescript
- [cs ai](https://github.com/uozuAho/cs-ai)
    - same as above, in C#
- [react ai](https://github.com/uozuAho/react_ai)
    - not really sure what i was trying to do here. Use react???
