This project trains and evaluates agents that play connect four.

It uses python, numpy and pytorch.

All source code is under src/

Code style is functional. Classes are mainly used as data bags,
with first class functions to operate on those classes. Type hints
are used as much as possible.

When making code changes, do the minimal amount of work needed to
fulfil the most recent prompt, then give control back to me. Don't
run tests, linting etc. I'll do all of that.
