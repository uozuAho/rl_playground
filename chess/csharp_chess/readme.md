# C# chess agents, experiments etc

Uses [TorchSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/TorchSharp) and [Chess-Coding-Adventure](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Coding-Adventure)

The chess implementation is much faster than pychess (at least 100x).
TorchSharp seems decent, but requires manual memory management when
using the GPU :(

# todo
- if above wrapper good:
  - update these docs
  - maybe: fix build warnings
